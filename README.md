# meme-picker
This is a project which allows you to pick any mood and you get the picture of a cat corresponding to the mood. you also have the option of choosing a gif instead
It was made with pure HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
I realy learnt a lot building this project. I learnt how to use the .includes function, .filter function,how to import and export modules.
It was a great learning curve for me.
